# A responsive Cooldown Calculator for Ingress


Hello everyone,
this is a first attempt on a Ingress Cooldwon Calculator, made after a specific request by a dear friend of mine.

## What to know
The Web App is made with JS, HTML and CSS.
First you have to choose the portal status: FRIENDLY or ENEMY/NEUTRAL (by default, FRIENDLY value is selected).
Then, you can choose every Mod you prefer (multi-hack or heat-sink), in the option menu.
You can delete all the values inserted by pressing the "Reset All" button or you can delete a single value by tapping the trash icon next to a Mod field.

## Other facts
There is a night mode that matches your device preference.

## Tips
Feel free to review the entire project. Every feedback will be appreciated.

## Legal things
I'm not associated in any ways with Ingress or Niantic. This project is just for fun and Niantic Lab owns all the rights.
