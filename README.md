# A responsive Cooldown Calculator for Ingress


Hello everyone,
this is a first attempt on a Ingress Cooldwon Calculator, made after a specific request by a dear friend of mine.

See app at https://filecc.github.io/cooldown-calculator-ingress/

## What to know
The Web App is made with JS, HTML and CSS.
First you have to choose the portal status: FRIENDLY or ENEMY/NEUTRAL (by default, FRIENDLY value is selected).
Then, you can choose every Mod you prefer (multi-hack or heat-sink), in the option menu.
You can delete all the values inserted by pressing the "Reset All" button or you can delete a single value by tapping the trash icon next to a Mod field.

The page automaticaly adapts accordingly to eventual in-game events that may affect cooldown timings and number of hacks, showing a nice info banner with event dates in your browser's time zone and remaining duration.

## Other facts
There is a night mode that matches your device preference.

## Tips
Feel free to review the entire project. Every feedback will be appreciated.

You may open an issue or pull request in case of any suggestion or report.

## Legal things
I'm not associated in any way with Ingress or Niantic. This project is just for fun and Niantic Labs owns all the rights.
